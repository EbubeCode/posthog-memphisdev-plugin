# Memphis.dev data processing platform

Memphis is a next-generation alternative to traditional message brokers.

A simple, robust, and durable cloud-native message broker wrapped with
an entire ecosystem that enables cost-effective, fast, and reliable development of modern queue-based use cases.

Memphis enables the building of modern queue-based applications that require
large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, rapid development,
extreme cost reduction, and a significantly lower amount of dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.
